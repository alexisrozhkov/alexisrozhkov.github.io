This is more of a "hello world" post, just to make sure that github pages and jekyll are hooked up correctly, but I decided that it'd be way cooler if it had some value on its own. So I'm sharing this great video, after which I got curious enough to read a bunch of articles on quantum computing approaches and related challenges.

Basically it demonstrates that effect of a polarizer cannot be explained just by attenuation of light, and as a result several other interpretations are possible. Anyway - enjoy :)
