# About me

I'm a computer vision engineer from St. Petersburg, Russia. I'm interested in AI in general, and in reinforcement learning in particular - seeing something **act** seems almost magical. Some day I want to build an embodied agent, let's see how it goes :)

I studied Computer Photonics (which is a mix of computer science and physics) at [ITMO university](http://en.ifmo.ru/en/), and worked at LG Russia R&D Lab as a research engineer on various projects after completing my Master's degree.

Now I work on Computer Vision at [mati](http://getmati.com/), which allows instant user identity verification online. 

Here I will post things I find worth sharing/discussing, hopefully someone might find it useful.
